# htmx-hello-world

## Description

This is a simple "Hello, World!" application built using htmx. htmx is a JavaScript library that allows you to create dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With htmx, you can easily add AJAX functionality to your web pages without having to write a lot of JavaScript code.

htmx works by adding special attributes to your HTML elements that tell it how to handle certain events, such as clicking a button or submitting a form. When an event occurs, htmx sends an HTTP request to the server and updates the page with the response.

This application demonstrates how to use htmx to create a simple web page that displays a message when a button is clicked. It also includes a basic Node.js server that serves the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and handles the AJAX requests.
